## 🌿 The Core Problem

Healthcare professionals spend up to 40% of their day on administrative data entry. This "documentation debt" leads to fatigue, errors, and less time for actual patients. 

**Salvia** resolves this by making documentation a natural byproduct of your care, rather than a separate chore, all while running securely on your own infrastructure.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Error-Proof Compliance:** Build mandatory image-verification checklists directly into your documentation workflow (e.g., preventing post-OP retained instruments).
- **Single Source of Truth:** A unified, searchable timeline where all clinical documentation is structured and instantly accessible.
- **Continuous Patient Feedback:** Automatically deploy customizable SMS or email feedback forms to patients post-discharge to catch clinical issues early.
- **Complete Oversight:** A high-performance management hub for clinic administrators to manage staff rosters, organizational hierarchies, and compliance dashboards.

## 🔐 Built for HIPAA & GDPR

Medical data is sacred. Salvia treats security as a foundation, not a feature:
- 100% Self-Hosted Open Source (Your data stays on your servers)
- Ready for End-to-End Encryption integrations
- Immutable audit trails for all verification and edits

## 🚀 Getting Started

This repository houses the marketing and documentation site for Salvia, built with **Next.js**.

To run this site locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🤝 Open Source

Salvia is completely free to self-host. We believe essential clinical tools shouldn't be locked behind enterprise paywalls. 

Join the overarching `off-by-2` organization and contribute to making clinical workflows safer for everyone.
