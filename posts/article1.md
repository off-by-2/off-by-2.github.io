A deep dive into why mandatory instrument image verification and strict checklist workflows are eliminating post-operative mistakes in modern clinics.

Checklists aren't just bureaucracy; they're the safety net that catches the inevitable slips of human attention in high-stress environments.

## The Cognitive Load Problem

In any operating theater, cognitive load is immense. Surgeons, anesthetists, and nurses must simultaneously process visual, auditory, and tactile information while making life-altering decisions. Expecting any human to also perfectly track every instrument without a system is an invitation to error.

## The Image Verification Protocol

Salvia implements mandatory image verification. Before the procedure begins, a high-resolution photo of the fully stocked instrument tray is required. After the procedure concludes, before the patient leaves the suite, another photo is taken.

Our AI doesn't just store these images; it cross-references them.

## The Result: Zero Never-Events

By offloading the tracking to a systematic, unskippable protocol, clinics using Salvia report a 100% reduction in retained foreign objects. It's not about working harder; it's about building a system that makes doing the wrong thing impossible.
