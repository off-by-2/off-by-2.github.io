The enterprise paywall is failing smaller clinics. Here is why taking ownership of your clinical data via open-source tools ensures better HIPAA parity and lower costs.

In the current healthcare technology landscape, data is locked behind expensive, proprietary silos. Clinics are often forced into costly subscriptions, limiting their operational agility and financial stability.

## The Cost of Proprietary Systems

Enterprise solutions often come with prohibitive per-seat licenses, confusing pricing tiers, and vendor lock-in. When a clinic wants to migrate, it discovers its own data is held hostage, requiring exorbitant extraction fees. This financial burden inevitably impacts patient care capacity.

## The Open-Source Alternative

Self-hosting an open-source solution like Salvia flips this model. The software is free. The clinic only pays for the infrastructure it uses. This dramatically reduces overhead, allowing resources to be reallocated directly to clinical operations.

## Security through Transparency

Proprietary vendors often rely on "security by obscurity." Open-source software, however, benefits from the scrutiny of a global community. Vulnerabilities are identified and patched rapidly. When configured correctly, a self-hosted instance of Salvia provides robust, HIPAA-compliant security that the clinic controls entirely.

Taking back ownership of data isn't just a technical decision; it's a strategic imperative for the future of independent healthcare.
