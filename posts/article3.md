Stop trying to decipher scattered nurses' notes at the end of the shift. Using a singular structured medical timeline saves an average of 2 hours per clinician daily.

The handover period between shifts is notoriously the most dangerous time for a patient in a clinical setting. Information is lost in translation, buried in unstructured text, or entirely forgotten.

## The Problem with Fragmented Documentation

When documentation occurs in silos—a note on a whiteboard, a quick scribble on a scrap of paper, a delayed entry in the EHR hours later—the cohesive narrative of patient care shatters. Context is lost, leading to redundant questioning, delayed interventions, and potential errors.

## The Singular Timeline Approach

Salvia addresses this by enforcing a single, chronological continuum of care. Every observation, intervention, and piece of feedback becomes a temporal node on this timeline. 

## The Benefits of Context

When a new clinician begins their shift, they aren't reading isolated reports; they are reviewing a continuous story. They immediately grasp the patient's trajectory, the effectiveness of ongoing treatments, and any emerging patterns of concern.

By transforming documentation from a retrospective chore into a real-time, structured narrative, Salvia not only reclaims hours of administrative time but fundamentally improves the continuity and quality of care.
